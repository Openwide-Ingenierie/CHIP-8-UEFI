# CHIP-8 Emulator for UEFI

You can learn more about CHIP-8 on the Wikip√©dia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to show what UEFI is capable of. This emulator is more like a proof than a real usable emulator. Indeed, the ROMs are hardcoded in the file `ROMS.h`. Of course, it's possible to read files in UEFI.
